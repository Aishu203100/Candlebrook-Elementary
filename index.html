            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <h2>Welcome to <br> <span id="name">

            <h3>Some things about Candlebrook Elementary:</h3>
            <div class="line">
            </div>
            <p>Candlebrook Elementary School is a highly rated, public school located in King Of Prussia,PA. It currently has 313 in grades K-4 and has a student teacher ratio of 12 to 1.<br>
                <br>
                Education has been part of the published history and culture of Upper Merion as far back as 1683 when William Penn persuaded a general assembly in Penn’s colony to order all parents, trustees and guardians to “bear responsibility for the education of their children.” It was a Swedish missionary who suggested that children in his settlement cease being tutored at home and be taught in a common school for that purpose. Many small schools have thrived to educate the children of the community since that time. By 1836, two years after a common school law was passed, Upper Merion had seven schools. The student population was 868.

It will include these three songs : Victor's March, Joy to the World , and March of the Romans. There will be mostly 4th graders, with some 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th graders preforming in the rehersal.

                        <p class="p_modal">Hello! My name is David Alexander and I am a special education teacher at Candlebrook Elementary. This is my fourth year as an Upper Merion Viking, and I am honored to be a part of your child’s life. Prior to teaching at Candlebrook Elementary, I taught for the Abington Area School District and The School District of Philadelphia. My certification is in Elementary Education (PreK-4), with the 5th & 6th grade certification add-on as well as Special Education grades PreK-8. I received my Bachelor’s Degree (Cum Laude) in Early Childhood Education at Temple University and my Master's Degree in Education (M.Ed.) with a concentration in Differentiated Instruction from LaSalle University. Prior to teaching, I served in the United States Marine Corps.
                            <br>
                            Whilst you might find me in room 153 located next to the main entrance on the way to the library (I’ve always wanted to use “whilst” in a sentence.. sounds fancy!), I have also been known to poke my head into other rooms throughout the day to spread the word about my world champion Dallas Cowboys. So many lessons can be taught while discussing the Dallas Cowboys such as: how to cope with feelings of jealousy as well as quantity discrimination (for instance, five Super Bowl victories is more than one Super Bowl victory).
                            <br>
                            In addition to myself, I am fortunate enough to work with a team of the best paraprofessionals in the district; Ms. April, Mrs. Griffith, Ms. B, and Ms. Kathy who keep me in line help ensure that your child’s needs are being met academically and emotionally.
                            <br>
                            Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions! I promise, I shower daily and, as the district administration has reminded me on numerous occasions, biting is "frowned upon" for staff.
                            <br>
                            Due to my nomadic tendencies, the best way to reach me is by calling the main office at 610-205-3700 or via email at <a href="mailto:DAlexander@UMASD.orgsubject:hi!">DAlexander@UMASD.org</a>. Previous methods included an intricate web of strings and cups (the fire department did not appreciate such efforts.. something about a kid-catching fire-hazard), a town crier (discontinued by popular demand), and owls (they were a hoot, but unsustainable).

                        <p class="p_modal">Hello parents! Welcome to the 2020-21 school year. As we embark on this journey together, let's remember to take it slow and remember we all have a common goal. The goal to stay healthy, safe and do the best we all can to help your child have a meaniful, productive year!
                            <br>
                            I am one of the learning support teachers at Candlebrook Elementary. My classroom is Room 141, located in the third and fourth grade wing of the school. I would like to tell you a little about myself. I am married with three children and live in Hatboro, Pennsylvania. This year begins my 27th year of teaching children with special needs, 18 of those years here in Upper Merion. I have a triple undergraduate certification in Early Childhood, Elementary and Special Education from Temple University. I also hold a Master's degree as a Reading Specialist from St. Joseph's University. I have a strong passion for teaching and working with children who face challenges, and I feel privileged to absolutely love my job. I try to make each day enjoyable, appreciate and value each child as the gift they are to the world. We have FUN while learning and I hope your child enjoys his/her educational journey at Candlebrook, even virtually!
                            <br>
                            Each year the special education program may look different because we design it around the needs of the children. During the first few weeks of the school year, I will be collecting data and assessing the needs of the students, even virtually. I hope to be following the regular schedule by mid September. I will be posting this schedule soon! This means providing direct instruction in either the Language Arts area and/or Math, pushing into classrooms to help adapt and modify the general education. I will be happy to talk to you regarding your child's individual schedule.
                            <br>
                            Ms. Alexandra Bohen is also a special education teacher, who is assigned to Candlebrook. You should know who your child's case manager is for the year, whether it is Ms. Bohen or myself. You would contact your child's case manager if you have questions or issues in regards to your child's programming or IEP. There are also two instructional assistants working with Ms. Bohen and I. Their names are Ms. Hansell, Ms. Kimmeshue and Mr. Williams.
                            <br>
                            Please do not hesitate to contact me at any time with problems or concerns. Email is best, I usually check it at least three times a day; (<a href="mailto:cammazzalorso@umasd.orgsubject:hi!">cammazzalorso@umasd.org</a>). During school hours, you can reach me on my cell phone which I will be keeping close by, but it will be muted. So I will check it frequently, if you have an immediate question or concern, feel free to use my cell, I just ask that you don't abuse it and respect my time.

                            My name is Debbie Bartelmo and I am beginning my 26th year of teaching. I graduated from Immaculata College with a Bachelor’s Degree in Early Childhood Education and Psychology. I received my Master’s Degree in Education with Certification in Reading from West Chester University.

                            I have three beautiful daughters, Savanna (21) and Kahlea (17) and Francesca (3). I often refer to my family in many of my lessons. (The children enjoy this very much.)

                            I hope your child enjoys having fun, playing games, arts and crafts, singing and using all five senses while learning because this is my teaching style. I truly believe that if a child feels safe, loved and happy, learning will take place very naturally.
                            <br>
                            I am looking forward to another exciting and successful year with your child.
                            Thank you in advance for your support!

Having a Bachelor of Science in Education in Early Childhood and Elementary Education (Temple University) and a Master of Education Degree (Cabrini University), I am forever continuing to develop my professional skill sets with UMASD and the Candlebrook Elementary School family.
                            <br>
                            I am a life-long learner who has had the pleasure of educating students in the Norristown Area School District for 7 years. With Norristown being my hometown, I gained expertise in building professional relationships that will last a life-time. In the last two years, I have brought my developed classroom management skills, in-depth instructional planning styles, collaborative demeanor and much more to the Upper Merion Area School District. Previously, I have educated children from Toddler Age through 5th Grade (Middle School) and I am beyond excited to be instructing children at the Kindergarten Grade level again!
                            <br>
                            As we progress through the current VIRTUAL school year, I will make every possible effort to reach each of your children based on their individual readiness levels, interests, and learning styles. In doing this, we will build an educational environment that will foster a love of learning and positive learning climate.

                            <br>
                            In my undergrad, I attended West Chester University, where I received a music degree. I taught private piano and played at a hotel for several years before pursuing a Master's Degree in Elementary Education at Cabrini University. Before arriving at Upper Merion in 2017, I taught in Philadelphia and the Norristown Area School District. In my teaching career, I have had the unique opportunity to teach almost every grade level K-6th, just missing out on 1st and 2nd! In 2018, I finished my Master's Degree in Educational Leadership and Principal Certification from Holy Family University.
                            <br>
                            Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my daughter, Naomi, and my wife, Liz who is a kindergarten teacher.

                        <p class="p_modal">This will be my fourth year at Candlebrook as a third grade teacher! I am so excited for another year of fun and engaging learning experiences. My main focus is to build a classroom community and form positive student relationships. I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Elementary Education/Early Childhood PK-4 from Shippensburg University in 2013. I was a member of the cheerleading squad all four years. I graduated last August with my Master's Degree in Social and Emotional Learning from Neumann University. I have formed such a passion for what I learned in my master's program and am looking forward to applying all of it to my classroom this year! I'm actually looking forward to continue my education in Social and Emotional Learning because it is so important for our children. I cannot wait to have a wonderful and successful school year with your child! Please do not hesitate to contact me at any time. The best way to contact me is through email <a href="mailto:sdifebbo@umasd.org;subject:hi!">sdifebbo@umasd.org.</a>

                        <p class="p_modal">Hello! Welcome to the world of second graders! In second grade my job is to continue preparing each child for a world-class education. I will strive to foster the love of learning and making connections to real life experiences. This letter will give you an opportunity to learn a little more about me and the person who will be spending a great deal of time with your child this school year! 


                            <br>
I grew up in the Upper Merion area and attended Upper Merion schools for all thirteen years! I received both my Bachelor’s and Master's Degrees in Early Childhood and Elementary Education from Cabrini University. I have also taken continuing education classes through Immaculata University. I am always continuing my quest for knowledge that will help serve my students. 

                            <br>


I have been happily teaching since 1999. I have taught Pre-K, Reading Remediation (Title 1), Kindergarten, and currently I reside in Second Grade.



                            <br>
I live right outside of King of Prussia with my husband, Andrew, and our 5 year old daughter, Kora Rose. She is the light of our lives! Kora will be starting Kindergarten this year! When I am not taking care of Kora (playing, guiding, exploring, reading to her, ...you get the idea ;-P) or teaching, I wnjoy walking or joggind, reading, and going to the beach in the summer. Some of my other favorite hobbies are spending time with family and friends, cooking or baking, watching sporting events (like the Phillies and Eagles), taking pictures, and shopping!

My goal is to provide a safe, nurturing, and loving environment where my students feel comfortable and happy. We spend a lot of time together and I feel we are a classroom family! My hope is that they feel the same way! I am looking forward to having your child in my class (virtual or in person)!

                        <p class="p_modal"> Hello!  My name is Allison Holland and I am thrilled to be your child's first grade teacher this year!   A fun fact about me is that I just got married this summer.  Mrs. Holland is my new name, but you might remember me as Miss Wahl.  This will be my tenth year as an elementary educator and my third wonderful year as a 1st grade teacher at Candlebrook.  I graduated from Temple University in 2010 with a Bachelor's Degree in Education and again in 2016 with my Master's of Reading and a Reading Specialist Certification from Cabrini University.  I am certified in Elementary K-6, Reading K-12, and also Art K-12!  I have taught Art, Reading, 2nd grade, 3rd grade, and 1st grade.  I love bringing my experience in reading and art into my classroom to help all of my students develop the same life-long love of reading and learning that I have.

                            Thanks for visiting my page! My name is Annmarie Kocher.  I began my year as the Candlebrook Librarian and am transitioning into my new role as a virtual 4th grade teacher! I am looking forward to my new role and meeting my new class!  Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my family.  I have a husband, a daughter and a dog named Chelsea. I love to read and travel (as long as I can get there by car)! If you have ever been into the CB library, you will know that I love Snoopy and have been collecting Snoopy items since I was a kid. I am looking forward to this new adventure!

                            Hello! My name is Debbie Laudermilch and I am your child's second grade teacher.  I am looking forward to sharing an exciting year with my second grade students.  I received my Bachelors Degree in Early Childhood/Elementary Education from Bloomsburg University. I attended Cabrini College to earn my Masters Degree in Education.  I have been happily teaching since 1997.  I have taught preschool children, remedial reading classes, kindergarten, and second grade.  I've been at Candlebrook since 1998. I currently live in Phoenixville with my husband Jim, my two sons, Nathan and Riley, and my 2 dogs, Mickey and Izzy.

                            <br>
                            I believe in providing a safe, nurturing, and loving learning environment where my students feel comfortable, accepted, and happy. It is important to me that they feel like an important part of the classroom family. I believe that children learn by example so I will be the best role model that I can be.
 
                            <br>
I believe that a parent’s job is to look out for their child- so please contact me if there is a problem or concern. E-mail is the best way to contact me. My e-mail address is <a href="mailto:dlaudermilch@umasd.org.; subject:Hi!;">dlaudermilch@umasd.org.</a>



                            <br>

I am looking forward to having your child in my virtual class! We have a spectacular school year ahead of us! Keep in touch with any questions or concerns at any time. I am here to do my best to make this a wonderful year!

                            Hello and welcome! My name is Ms Manon and I am the general music teacher and 3rd grade strings instructor for Candlebrook Elementary School. 
                            <br>
                            Our classrrom theme is Musical Explorer's and our mantra  is I Can Sing It   I Can Say It  I Can Play It  I Can Dance It . Throughout the year students will explore music using their voices, playing classroom instruments, dancing, listening and describing, as well as creating and performing.
 
                            <br>
When not sharing my love of music in the classroom, I enjoy attending musical performances, traveling and spending time with friends and family.

                            I received my Bachelor's Degree in Social Studies Education from Indiana University-Bloomington in 1994.  I began my career as the third grade teacher in the Gifted Program at PS 163 in New York City where I taught for a number of years.  While in New York, I earned my Masters Degree in Curriculum and Instruction from Columbia University's Teachers College.  Since arriving at Candlebrook nineteen years ago, I've had the privilege of helping students fulfill their learning potentials by providing them with challenging and meaningful enrichment opportunities.

                            I am thrilled to be part of the Candlebrook community. Although this is my second year with Upper Merion, it is the start of my sixteenth in the field of education. Besides being a reading specialist, I have also worked as a classroom teacher (most recently in the Lower Merion School District), a Literacy Coach (Children's Literacy Initiative in Philadelphia) and a graduate education adjunct for Cabrini College. My education career started as a third grade teacher in St. Petersburg, Florida, where I lived for several years prior to my current home in Ardmore.
                            <br>
                            On an educational level, I have a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing, a Master's Degree in Elementary Education (both from the University of South Florida), and a Reading Specialist Certification through Rosemont College. When I am not teaching, I enjoy spending time with my family, water-skiing, traveling and writing. Another interest of mine is mindfulness and I attended a course through the Penn Program for Mindfulness in 2015.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions at <a href="mailto:lmazinas@umasd.org; subject:Hi!;">lmazinas@umasd.org</a>. Although the start of 2020-21 will be different due to virtual instruction, I am confident that it will still be an amazing year!

                            Hi!  This is my 3rd year teaching Kindergarten in Upper Merion.  I grew up in Pottstown, PA (right down 422).  I graduated from Syracuse University in 2014 with a Bachelor's of Science degreee in Inclusive Elementary and Special Education.  During my time at Syracuse I was a member of the women's lacrosse team, and have even played semi-professionally!  I am currently a part of the Reading Specialist Graduate Program at Cabrini University.  Fun fact, I got engaged last school year and my new last name will be Eckroth come June of 2022!   


                            <br>
                            When I am not adventuring with my fiance, Ben I like to spend time with my family.  I especially love spending time with my nephew Owen who turned 1 year old in June!  Most of my Sundays are filled with coaching lacrosse and watching the Eagles during football season.   During the summer you will find me on the beaches of Sea Isle City and a book in hand. 
 
                            <br>
I love teaching Kindergarten and can't wait to grow with your little learners!

                            Hello!  My name is Lisa Popelik and I am very excited to work with your children this year!  This is my thirteenth year teaching at Candlebrook and my twelfth year teaching first grade.  I grew up in King of Prussia and graduated from Upper Merion.  I earned a dual certificate in Early Childhood and Elementary Education from West Chester University.  I am also certified to teach Middle School math and english/language arts.  I earned my Masters degree from Gratz College.
                            <br>
                            When I'm not teaching, I love spending time with my husband, daughter, and son.  My daughter, Courtney, is 9 and going into fourth grade this year, and my son, Benjamin, is 6 and going into first grade this year.  My family got a chocolate lab mix puppy this summer, named Sadie.
 
                            <br>
I am looking forward to a successful 2020-2021 school year.  This year is starting off different than usual, but we will still make the most of it and have a rewarding year together!  Please feel free to contact me by email at any time.

                            Hello! My name is Dorothy Raginsky. I began my year as the Roberts Librarian and am transitioning into my new role as a virtual 4th grade teacher!

                            I have been a resident of Upper Merion for over forty years.  I am proud to live, and now work, in this wonderful district.  I am an Upper Merion high school graduate.  I hold a master's degree plus 30 credits from Cabrini College and St. Joseph's University.  I hold certifications as both a Reading Specialist and Elementary Educator.
                            <br>
                              I live less than a mile from Candlebrook.  I hope you will see me walking to work when the weather is nice.  I have three sons, Colin, Patrick and Michael all graduates of Penn State University (Pat and Mike also graduated from UM).  They are all happily working and pursuing great careers.
   I believe enjoyment is the key to good reading. We can work together to create a love of reading in your child.  I will work to make your child successful and excited about learning and achieving.

                            Hello! My name is Melissa Wanamaker and I'm so excited to be your child's First Grade Teacher! This will be my fifth year teaching first grade, but I also taught kindergarten too!  When i was in elementary school, I actually went to Candlebrook myself. I graduated from Upper Merion in 2008 and went on to study Elementary Education at West Chester University. I obtained my Master's degree in Social Emotional Learning in 2019 from Neumann University and currently still taking more courses to further my education. It has been an absolute dream to work collaboratively with the amazing faculty at Candlebrook. We really are a family. 
                            <br>
My goal is to create safe, fun learning environment and foster a love for learning in each child.  I will use my creativity to provide a variety of lessons that will allow for positive student interaction and hands-on learning experiences. We will explore, create and innovate together! I also believe in a strong school-home connection, so please contact me with any questions or concerns you may have at any time.


 
                            <br>
E-mail is the best way to contact me as I check my e-mail several times a day and throughout the night.  My e-mail address is MWanamaker@umasd.org .  You can also reach me by phone here at school, but will need to leave a message on voice mail if school is in session. You may also send in a written note.  To better ensure that I receive it, please place it in your child’s homework folder. I check those every morning. 





                            <br>

I am looking forward to a wonderful year ahead with you and your child. Please don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.  No question is too small! Let’s work together to make this a fantastic year!

                            I am thrilled to be part of the Candlebrook community. Although this is my second year with Upper Merion, it is the start of my sixteenth in the field of education. Besides being a reading specialist, I have also worked as a classroom teacher (most recently in the Lower Merion School District), a Literacy Coach (Children's Literacy Initiative in Philadelphia) and a graduate education adjunct for Cabrini College. My education career started as a third grade teacher in St. Petersburg, Florida, where I lived for several years prior to my current home in Ardmore.
                            <br>
                            On an educational level, I have a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing, a Master's Degree in Elementary Education (both from the University of South Florida), and a Reading Specialist Certification through Rosemont College. When I am not teaching, I enjoy spending time with my family, water-skiing, traveling and writing. Another interest of mine is mindfulness and I attended a course through the Penn Program for Mindfulness in 2015.
